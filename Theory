It is an algo used to train the neural networks.
Train=>finding the correct value of weights and biases on the given data.

Working:-
steps:-
0)initialize w,b
1)You select a point(row)/(student)
2)predict(lpa)->forward propagation(dot product)
3)choose a loss function
  L=square((y-y'))
4)Update weights and biases using the gradient descent
W(new)=W(old)-n(dL/dW(old))
b(new)=b(old)-n(dL/db(old))             //=>Partial derivatives

Now,our task is to calculate these 9 derivatives.
